    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Updated Date:</strong> 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to LooksPro. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data and facial image information. This policy explains how we collect, use, store, and disclose your data when you use the App.</p>

    <h2>2. What Data We Collect & Why</h2>
    <p><strong>Face/Photo Data:</strong> When you upload or take a photo, we use it only to provide AI-based facial balance insights and personalized style suggestions. We do not use facial recognition or biometric identification.</p>
    <p><strong>Basic Personal Information:</strong> We may collect minimal data, such as gender, to help the AI generate more accurate insights.</p>
    <p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect limited technical data (like feature usage or session duration) to improve performance and user experience.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>• To provide the main service — AI analysis and personalized feedback.</p>
    <p>• To enhance AI models and app performance.</p>
    <p>• For security, fraud prevention, and legal compliance.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
    <p>Uploaded photos are processed securely and deleted immediately after analysis — usually within 60 seconds. We do not store facial images or identifiable data on our servers once processing is complete. Any history visible in the app is stored locally on your device and can be deleted by you anytime.</p>

    <h2>4A. Face Data Usage & Retention</h2>
    <p>LooksPro processes selfies in real time to provide AI-powered appearance and style insights. We do not sell, share, or use this data for facial recognition or identification. All images are automatically deleted after analysis. Any saved results remain only on your device for your convenience and can be deleted at any time.</p>

    <h2>4B. App Permissions (Camera, Photos & Microphone)</h2>
    <p>LooksPro uses your <strong>camera</strong>, <strong>photo library</strong>, and <strong>microphone</strong> only to run its AI analysis features:</p>
    <p>• <strong>Camera / Photos:</strong> Used to take or upload a selfie for instant AI processing. Images are deleted right after analysis.</p>
    <p>• <strong>Microphone:</strong> Used only for voice-based analysis features; audio is processed in real time and never stored or shared.</p>
    <p>We never access these features in the background. You can manage or revoke permissions anytime in your device settings.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing & Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties for marketing or advertising. Information is disclosed only if required by law.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We use industry-standard security measures such as encrypted data transmission and secure temporary storage to protect your data. However, no system is completely secure, and a minimal risk may remain.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights & Controls</h2>
    <p>• LooksPro does not permanently store face or voice data — most information is deleted automatically after analysis.</p>
    <p>• You can delete your local analysis history anytime in the app.</p>
    <p>• You can contact us anytime for questions about data handling or to confirm deletion.</p>
    <p>• You can withdraw consent or stop using the app whenever you choose.</p>

    <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>LooksPro is not intended for children under 10 years old. We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors. If you believe a child is using the app, please contact us so we can delete the data immediately.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. The revised version will be posted here with an updated “Last Updated” date. Continued use of the app after updates means you accept the new policy.</p>

    <h2>10. Contact Information</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or requests about your data or this policy, contact us at:
      <a href="mailto:lookspro.ai@gmail.com" style="color:#ff66b2; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none;">lookspro.ai@gmail.com</a>
